# Zabbix template for monitoring ScyllaDB by JMX

## Overview

For Zabbix version: 5.4 and higher  

This is based off the [Official Zabbix template for monitoring Apache Cassandra by JMX](https://git.zabbix.com/projects/ZBX/repos/zabbix/browse/templates/db/cassandra_jmx/).  Please see that repo for instructions.  

I have removed any JMX beans and values that are missing in ScyllaDB and updated the discovery rules as needed.
